# arrange_cards
compose playing cards on A4 sheet


--
Before you run it first time change absolute image paths in arrange_func.sh !
Then put both scripts and arrange_data directory in $PATH.

Then you can try to run arrange.sh in sample_env directory:
arrange.sh -i arrange.txt -o output.pdf


Composed cards must be 688x983 to fits perfectly. Otherwise geometry parameter in arrange_func.sh must be altered.
